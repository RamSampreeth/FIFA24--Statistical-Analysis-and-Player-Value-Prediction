This project delves into the domain of soccer player valuation by employing regression and hypothesis testing techniques on the FIFA 24 Player Stats Dataset. The primary objective is to predict player values using linear regression models, unraveling insights into the dynamics of market valuation. Additionally, the project explores the impact of various attributes on predicted values through hypothesis testing, offering a comprehensive understanding of the role-dependent dynamics in player valuation. The combination of regression analysis and hypothesis testing equips soccer clubs with valuable tools for budgeting and team optimization. We used a variety of regression approaches: the OLS model with log transformations and the OLS model with Box-Cox transformation. We checked Q-Q plots for residual normality and analyzed the performance of the model based on R2, adjusted R2, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
